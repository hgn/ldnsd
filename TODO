Signal Handler: Gracefull shutdown at TERM signal so that a user can use kill
-p <pid> to shutdown the server

Introduce configuration variables for ipv4 und ipv6 bind.  After that the
socket should listen to this addresses only.

Port randomization for outgoing port. Let the OS choose the emphereal port,
something strange to limit this is not that clever. On the other hand: how
rand() is the kernel port selector?

A datum can be in two different local databases: the local authority database
and the cache database. In the local cache database entries are not decoded,
they are plein forwarded without modification. Therefore no deeper knowledge of
the encoded data is available. In the second case the authority database the
entries are saved in a "human" encoding, that means that the datum must be
encoded into a wire format each time. This is causes by the fact that some
parts of the RR can be changed (and therefore labals can be changed). This is a
little bit awkward if the encoder cannot trust the labels anymore. Therefore we
go the easy way and encode the data every time. Later this can be optimized by
save the memory location and introduce a dirty flag or similar.
